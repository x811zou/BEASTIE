# BEASTIE

BEASTIE (Bayesian Estimation of Allele Specific Transcription Integrating across Exons) is a software suite for identifying allele-specific-expression (ASE) from regulatory variants in data from RNA-seq and WGS.
BEASTIE uses a Bayesian hierarchical model to integrate prior information with read count data and genetic data. Using MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo), BEASTIE efficiently performs posterior inference to estimate effect sizes of ASE. <br>
BEASTIE has been found to be substantially more accurate than other tests based on the binomial distribution.
